The long-hidden time
Calls us back again
No matter where we are
The end is always you

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

In the story that is you
I dream again
No matter what moment comes
I will find you

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you

On the white road where petals were flying
You and I will happy
If we can meet again

'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
You are the spring
I've waited for a long time
'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you
Even if it gets erased again
All my life is you
