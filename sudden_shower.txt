I didn't want it to stop
On the day you first came to me
I hope it's not the kind of rain
That soaks you for a while
I've been desperately hoping

Do you know how I feel too?
Me, who only pictured you every day
It seeps into my heart again today

You are like a gift given by the sky
In a world where I stand alone
I will protect you
One day, you suddenly fell like a shower
I'm calling you again today;
A precious person to me

The falling rain suddenly wakes me up
I'm lost in my thoughts about you

Now come to me
I'm waiting as always
I will hold your hand tightly

You are like a gift given by the sky
In a world wherе I stand alone
I will protect you
One day, suddеnly like a shower
Although you are the one who got off
I'm calling you again today;
A precious person to me

Painful memories that I wanted to forget
Just let it go with the raindrops
Even if I'm tired
Sometimes even if the sky is cloudy
Don't forget that I exist

You are love
One and only love
There will never be a love like yours again
I don't forget
Even the little memories you gave me
I'm engraving it today too
You are a gift to me
